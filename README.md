* [Vermicomposter v.1.0](https://github.com/OikoSol/Waste/blob/master/Vermicomposterb1.0.pdf)

A Vermicomposter is a a method of recycling the nutrients in non-fatty kitchen waste by the use of soil bacteria and composting worms, which consume the waste and produce a high nutrient liquid for plant watering, worm castings and humus, a soil-like material that can be used as soil amendment in gardening or for seeding.

# Target Technologies

In this category, I will list some of the technologies that can treat biowaste into useful product (such as fish food, a crop, an organic nutrient solution or soil, for example) and recycle other wastes (such as plastic) into useful materials.

* **Black Soldier Fly Larvae (BSFL) Composting**: BSFL Composting is a method of using the larvae of the fly species Hermetia illucens to convert food waste and/or feces into a source of protein for use as, for example, fish food.
* **Composting/Vermicomposting**: Composting is a method of allowing food waste and other organic matter to convert into humus and soil through the use of bacteria, fungi and different worm species.
* **Bokashi Composting**: Bokashi composting is a method of allowing food waste and other organic matter to convert into humus and soil using a select amount of bacteria and a fermentation process.
* **Dry-Toilet/Composting Toilet**: A Dry-Toilet/Composting Toilet is a device that treats human waste such as urine and feces through an aerobic composting process and little water use to produce humus and soil.
* **Anthroponics**: Anthroponics is a cultivation and wastewater treatment method that safely grows edible vegetables from human biowaste such as urine, without the need for soil and also conserving water. In theory, it can also be possible to grow fish by incorporating BSFL composting into the process, with the larvae serving as fish food.
* **Localized Wastewater Treatment**: A localized wastewater treatment is a technology that emulates contemporary wastewater treatment plants at a reduced scale and takes human biowaste (such as urine and feces) to produce clean discharge water and (ideally) no sludge.
